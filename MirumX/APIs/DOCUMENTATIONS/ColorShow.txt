Show characters in color from Ascii codes, string literals and Batch variables,
and/or set the color of text used in posterior screen output.

   ColorShow  /bf  { code[*times] | "literal" | variable[:[ñ]wide[:fill]] } ...

<bf> specify a BackFore-ground color attribute (see COLOR /? for more info).
<code>, <times>, <wide> and <fill> must be decimal numbers up to 255 each.

<times> repeat the previous Ascii <code> character that number of times;
a "X" letter may be used instead of the asterisk.

Use two quote characters together to insert a quote inside a "literal string".

<wide> define a field to show the variable value: justified at left by default,
or justified at rigth if <wide> have minus sign, or centered if <wide> have
plus sign; the field is filled with spaces, or with the <fill> code character.

A color attribute may be inserted before any show parameter, that set the color
for following parameters; the default color is the one at the initial cursor
position. Use / alone to indicate the default color, use // to indicate the
default color attribute in reverse video.

Control characters embedded in strings are not properly shown; individual Ascii
codes for 9, 10 and 13 values (TAB, LineFeed and Return) are correctly shown.

If a color attribute is the last (or only) parameter, then set the color that
will be used to show text in all posterior output to the screen.

At end, the default attribute of initial cursor position is returned in
ERRORLEVEL as a *decimal value* = (Background << 16) + Foreground
