Welcome to MirumX! The contents of this folder are required for MirumX to run, so don't delete them

What is MirumX?
MirumX is a multipurpose tool that provides you with a vast library of API's, intergrated directly into the MS-DOS type Batch language.....
It was originally based from SD-Security, the first version. SD-Security is 4000+ lines of MS-DOS programming that provides an easy to use interface with millions of undocumented CMD features (Documented in the SD-Security update history file).
MirumX is a simplified version, that been programmed from scratch. SD-Security was one compressed script that was 'independant'. SD-Security could be placed in a folder, and it would generate scripts in a hidden folder called SDS_Files.
MirumX isn't independant, instead it requires multiple files to run it. This allows so much more to be achieved, because it isn't limited to basic commands and can edited to suite your needs.
